Sub-modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~

AequilibraE is organized in submodules that are often derived from the traditional 4-step model. However, many other
modules have been added and are expected to be added in the future. The current modules are:

- distribution
- matrix
- paths
- transit

Contributions can be made to the existing modules or in the form of new modules.
