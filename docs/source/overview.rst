Sub-modules
-----------

AequilibraE is organized in submodules that are often derived from the traditional 4-step model. However, other modules
have already been added or are expected to be added in the future. The current modules are:

- distribution
- paths
- transit
- matrix

Contributions can be made to the existing modules or in the form of new modules.
