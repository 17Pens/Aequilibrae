API Documentation
==================
An attentive reader will notice that the documentation of different modules are quite different, and that is due to the
fact that API documentation came as an afterthought during AequilibraE's development. On that note, documentation is
under active development and is probably the best place for a new user to start contributing to it.

.. note::
   If the documentation here is not sufficient, you can always resort to the mailing list: aequilibrae@googlegroups.com
